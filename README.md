# Equilibrium-Simulator

Space capsules experience hypersonic velocities upon re-entering Earth's atmopshere, resulting in shock wave formation around the front of the vehicle. As a result of this, the air behind the shock wave begins to dissociate and the vehicle experiences extremely high temperatures and pressures at its surface. This program accurately predicts the post shock conditions and composition based on a given set of initial freestream conditions and blunt body re-entry vehicle geometry, and have been validated against both stagnation point hand calculations and NASA's web CEA.

Future plans for this project include parallelizing shock calculations to significantly improve scaling efficiency, as well as implementing a non-equilibrium model to estimate composition as a funciton of distance behind the shock.
